     <p align="justify">The original Latin word "universitas" refers in general to "a number of
         persons associated into one body, a society, company,
         community, guild, corporation, etc." At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds,
         specialized"associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters
         issued by princes,prelates, or the towns in which they were located" came to be denominated by this general
         term. Like other guilds,they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members.<br>

         In modern usage the word has come to mean "An institution of higher education offering tuition in mainly
         non-vocational subjectsand typically having the power to confer degrees,"with the earlier emphasis on its
         corporate organization considered asapplying historically to Medieval universities.</p>
